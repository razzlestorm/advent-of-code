"""
The median works for part 1 because of the optimality property: it is the value with the lowest absolute distance to the data.

Unfortunately, this does not work for part 2, because the "distances" (measured in fuel consumption) are no longer linear: if you double the distance, you need more than double the fuel.

In fact, the distances are the triangle numbers, which are defined by n Ã— (n+1) / 2. Because of the n2 in there, we know that the arithmetic mean has the lowest total distance to the data.
